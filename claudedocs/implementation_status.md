# Implementation Status - Invoice Workflow MVP

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-10
**Status:** In Progress - Week 1 Day 3

---

## ✅ Completed Components

### 1. Email Parsing Node (Day 2) ✅
**Status:** COMPLETE with LLM-powered extraction

**Implementation:**
- `src/nodes/email_parser.py` - AI-powered email parser using LLM
- Multi-project support with consultant deduplication
- Handles consultants appearing in multiple projects
- Extracts: sender, subject, billing_month, consultant activities with project names

**Tests:**
- `tests/unit/test_email_parser.py` - 4/4 tests passing
- Test fixtures: `sample_email.txt` (multi-project), `sample_email_simple.txt` (single project)
- Coverage: 90% on email_parser.py

**Key Features:**
- LLM-based extraction (no regex)
- Structured JSON output
- Proper error handling
- State progression to "project_resolution"

---

### 2. Project Resolution Node (Day 3) ✅
**Status:** COMPLETE with ReAct agent

**Implementation:**
- `src/nodes/project_resolution.py` - ReAct agent for intelligent project matching
- Tool: `get_boondmanager_projects()` - fetches projects from BoondManager API
- Fuzzy matching: case-insensitive, partial matches
- Updates consultant activities with `project_id` and `client_id`

**Tests:**
- `tests/unit/test_project_resolution.py` - 3/3 tests passing
- Real ReAct agent execution (not mocked)
- Test output shows agent reasoning
- Coverage: 91% on project_resolution.py

**Agent Flow:**
1. Receives unique project names from email
2. Uses tool to fetch BoondManager projects
3. Performs fuzzy matching
4. Returns JSON mapping
5. Updates state with resolved IDs

---

### 3. Workflow Skeleton ✅
**Status:** COMPLETE with conditional branching

**Implementation:**
- `src/workflow.py` - LangGraph workflow with 6 nodes
- Conditional routing after reconciliation
- Node sequence: parse_email → resolve_projects → reconcile → [validate OR notify] → generate_invoices → notify

**Nodes:**
1. `parse_email` - Email extraction ✅
2. `resolve_projects` - Project/client ID resolution ✅
3. `reconcile` - CRA comparison (stub)
4. `validate` - Schema + business rules (stub)
5. `generate_invoices` - Invoice creation (stub)
6. `notify` - Logging results (stub)

**Conditional Logic:**
```python
reconcile → IF has_discrepancies → notify (END)
         → IF all match → validate → invoice → notify (END)
```

**Fan-out Ready:**
- Notes added for future parallel reconciliation using `Send()` API
- Current: sequential processing (MVP)

---

### 4. Core Infrastructure ✅

**LLM Configuration:**
- `src/llm_config.py` - Centralized LLM setup
- Environment-based configuration (LLM_BASE_URL, LLM_API_KEY, LLM_MODEL)
- Returns `BaseChatModel` (works with ChatOpenAI, ChatOllama, etc.)

**State Models:**
- `src/models/state.py` - Pydantic models
- `EmailData` - parsed email metadata (no single project_name)
- `ConsultantActivity` - with project_name field for multi-project support
- `InvoiceWorkflowState` - main workflow state

**BoondManager API Client:**
- `src/integrations/boond_client.py` - Async HTTP client
- Methods: get_projects, get_project_deliveries, get_times_report, get_contacts, generate_invoice
- JWT authentication with retry logic

---

## 🔄 In Progress

### Reconciliation Node
**Status:** Stub created, implementation pending

**Next Steps:**
1. Create ReAct agent for CRA reconciliation
2. Tools needed:
   - `get_consultant_cra_data()` - fetch CRA from BoondManager
   - `compare_days()` - compare declared vs actual
3. Discrepancy detection logic
4. Update `has_discrepancies` flag in state

---

## ⏳ Pending Components

### Validation Node
- Schema validation
- Business rules validation
- Amount calculation

### Invoice Generation Node
- Create invoice in BoondManager
- Mark CRAs as validated

### Notification Node
- Currently logs results
- Email sending deferred (MVP)

---

## Architecture Decisions

### 1. Multi-Project Support
- EmailData: removed single `project_name` field
- ConsultantActivity: added `project_name` field
- Supports consultants appearing in multiple projects

### 2. ReAct Agents
- Project resolution uses create_react_agent
- Tools provide BoondManager API access
- GPT-optimized prompts (markdown, concise, imperative)

### 3. Stateless MVP
- No database persistence
- In-memory state only
- BoondManager as system of record

### 4. Fan-out Strategy
- Sequential for MVP
- `Send()` API notes added for future parallel reconciliation

## Test Coverage

**Overall:** 48%
- `email_parser.py`: 90%
- `project_resolution.py`: 91%
- `llm_config.py`: 100%
- `models/state.py`: 100%
- `config.py`: 100%

**Test Files:**
- `tests/unit/test_email_parser.py` - 4 tests, all passing
- `tests/unit/test_project_resolution.py` - 3 tests, all passing

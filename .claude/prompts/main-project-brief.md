# HR Automation SaaS for Startups - Project Brief

## Project Overview

We are building a SaaS platform to automate HR tasks for startups, with initial integration focused on **BoondManager CRM** (a CRM system designed for startups). The goal is to develop an intelligent agent using **LangGraph/LangChain** that can automate complex, multi-step workflows, with plans to evolve into a fully autonomous bot capable of handling unstructured tasks and queries.

## Current Focus: Automated Invoicing Workflow

### Problem Statement

We need to automate the end-to-end invoicing process that currently requires manual verification, validation, and execution across multiple systems. This workflow is complex, involves data reconciliation between systems, multiple validation checkpoints, and requires both automated processing and potential human oversight.

### Input Data Structure

The workflow receives monthly input data containing:
- **List of projects** for the billing period
- **Per project breakdown**:
  - List of workers involved in the project
  - Number of days worked by each worker (from external time-tracking system)
  - Total cost per worker for the month
  - Project-specific billing details

### Workflow Requirements (Happy Path)

1. **Data Reconciliation**: Cross-check external system data against BoondManager internal data
2. **Validation**: Ensure both systems agree on hours, rates, and totals
3. **Timesheet Validation**: Automatically validate worker timesheets against recorded hours
4. **Invoice Generation**: Create invoices per project based on validated data
5. **Invoice Verification**: Perform quality checks on generated invoices
6. **Client Delivery**: Send validated invoices to respective clients

### Key Challenges

- Multi-step process with dependencies between stages
- Need for data validation and reconciliation across systems
- Error handling and exception management
- Potential need for human-in-the-loop intervention
- State management across the workflow
- Scalability for processing multiple projects simultaneously

## Technical Approach: LangGraph Architecture

We're using LangGraph for its strengths in building complex, stateful AI workflows. The architecture needs to be optimized for:
- Modularity and reusability
- Clear error handling and recovery
- Human oversight capabilities
- Extensibility for future autonomous features

## Initial Architecture Design Goals

We need an architecture that addresses:

### 1. Modularity
- Each major step (validation, generation, verification) should be a distinct, testable component
- Components should be reusable for other HR workflows in the future

### 2. State Management
- Track the progress of each invoice through the workflow
- Maintain context about validation results, errors, and decisions
- Support concurrent processing of multiple projects

### 3. Error Handling & Recovery
- Graceful handling of data mismatches
- Clear error messages for debugging
- Ability to retry failed steps
- Escalation paths for unresolvable issues

### 4. Human Oversight
- Checkpoints where human approval may be needed
- Dashboard for monitoring workflow progress
- Intervention points for edge cases

### 5. Integration Points
- BoondManager CRM API integration
- External time-tracking system integration
- Email/notification system for invoice delivery
- Future: Additional HR systems and tools

## First Steps - What We Need to Build

### Phase 1: Architecture Definition
1. **Define the state schema**: What information flows through the workflow?
2. **Identify nodes**: What are the discrete processing steps?
3. **Map edges and conditionals**: How do we route between steps based on outcomes?
4. **Design the multi-agent structure**: Should we use specialized agents or a monolithic approach?

### Phase 2: Core Components
1. **Data reconciliation module**: Compare external vs internal data
2. **Validation engine**: Rule-based and LLM-assisted validation
3. **Invoice generation service**: Template-based document creation
4. **Quality assurance checks**: Verify invoice accuracy

### Phase 3: Integration & Orchestration
1. **API connectors**: BoondManager and external systems
2. **LangGraph workflow**: Wire up the complete process
3. **Monitoring & logging**: Track execution and errors
4. **Human-in-the-loop interface**: Approval and intervention UI

## Questions to Address

As we design the architecture, please help me think through:

1. **Agent Design**: Should we use a single orchestrator agent with tool-calling, or multiple specialized agents coordinated through a supervisor pattern?

2. **State Management**: What's the optimal state schema for tracking invoice workflow progress? Should we use persistent storage or in-memory state?

3. **Subgraph Strategy**: Which parts of the workflow should be encapsulated as subgraphs for reusability?

4. **Error Handling**: What's the best pattern for handling data mismatches - immediate escalation, automatic retry with adjusted parameters, or LLM-based resolution attempt?

5. **Scalability**: How should we handle batch processing of multiple projects? Parallel execution, sequential with shared state, or hybrid?

6. **Human-in-the-Loop**: At what points in the workflow should we require human approval? Should this be configurable based on confidence scores?

## Expected Outcomes

By the end of our collaboration, we should have:

1. A detailed architectural diagram showing the LangGraph structure
2. Defined state schema with all necessary data fields

## Future Vision

While our immediate focus is the invoicing workflow, keep in mind that this architecture should be extensible for:
- Additional HR workflows (onboarding, time-off management, performance reviews)
- Fully autonomous question-answering capabilities
- Unstructured task execution based on natural language requests
- Multi-tenant support for different startup clients

## Next Steps

Please start by:
1. Reviewing the linked LangGraph documentation
2. Proposing a high-level architecture for the invoicing workflow
3. Identifying any ambiguities or additional information needed
4. Suggesting the optimal multi-agent vs single-agent approach for this use case

Let's build something robust, scalable, and truly helpful for startup HR teams!

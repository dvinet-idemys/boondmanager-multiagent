# Mission: Architecture Multi-Agent LangGraph pour Système de Gestion Financière ESN

## Context
I need to design a production-grade, fully autonomous multi-agent system using LangGraph to handle critical financial operations for an IT consulting company (ESN) using BoondManager CRM. This system will handle:

1. **Client Billing Process**: Validate timesheets, reconcile data, generate and send invoices
2. **Supplier Invoice Processing**: Extract, validate and reconcile supplier invoices
3. **Activity Report Validation**: Cross-check consultant declarations with client notifications
4. **Resource Tracking**: Monitor consultant activities and discrepancies

## Critical Requirements

### Quality & Reliability
- **ZERO-ERROR TOLERANCE**: This handles financial transactions - any mistake has serious business consequences
- **Full Autonomy**: The system must operate independently with minimal human intervention
- **Data Integrity**: All validations must be exhaustive and cross-referenced
- **Audit Trail**: Complete traceability of all decisions and actions
- **Rollback Capability**: Ability to reverse actions if errors are detected

### Technical Constraints
- Integration with BoondManager API (ESN-specialized CRM)
- Email processing (incoming/outgoing)
- PDF/Document extraction and analysis
- Multi-step validation workflows
- Conditional branching based on validation results

## Required Research & Analysis

Before proposing any architecture, you MUST:

1. **Deep-dive into these documentations** (go beyond surface-level reading):
   - https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/multi_agent
   - https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/multi_agent/#multi-agent-architectures
   - https://blog.langchain.com/agent-middleware/?utm_medium=email&_hsmi=14881600&utm_content=14881600&utm_source=hs_email
   - https://blog.langchain.com/reflection-agents/

2. **Analyze ALL available LangGraph design patterns**:
   - Network architectures (supervisor, hierarchical, etc.)
   - State management patterns
   - Error handling and recovery mechanisms
   - Human-in-the-loop vs fully autonomous patterns
   - Reflection and self-correction patterns

3. **Critically evaluate** which patterns are optimal for financial operations requiring:
   - Multi-step validation
   - Data reconciliation across systems
   - Conditional workflows
   - Error detection and correction
   - State persistence and checkpointing

## Concrete Use Cases to Address

### Use Case 1: Client Billing Workflow
**Input**: Client email with consultant names and worked days
**Process**:
1. Extract structured data from email
2. Query BoondManager API for each consultant's activity reports (CRA)
3. Cross-validate declared days vs. CRA days for each consultant
4. IF mismatch detected:
   - Invalidate the CRA in BoondManager
   - Send notification email to consultant with discrepancies
5. IF all data matches:
   - Generate invoice in BoondManager
   - Send invoice to client via email
6. Log all actions for audit

### Use Case 2: Supplier Invoice Processing
**Input**: Supplier invoice received via email (PDF attachment)
**Process**:
1. Extract invoice data (supplier, amount, period, services)
2. Query BoondManager for corresponding purchase orders/contracts
3. Validate consistency:
   - Supplier identity
   - Amounts and rates
   - Service periods
   - Contract terms
4. IF validation passes:
   - Register invoice in BoondManager
   - Flag for payment processing
5. IF validation fails:
   - Generate detailed discrepancy report
   - Request human review with specific issues highlighted

### Use Case 3: Proactive Activity Report Monitoring
**Scheduled Process**:
1. Query all pending CRAs in BoondManager
2. Check for upcoming client billing deadlines
3. Identify consultants with missing or incomplete CRAs
4. Send automated reminders with specific requirements
5. Escalate to managers if deadlines are at risk

## Your Deliverables

Provide a comprehensive solution including:

### 1. Architecture Analysis (Critical Evaluation)
- **Pattern Selection Justification**: Explain WHY each chosen pattern is optimal for this use case
- **Alternatives Considered**: What other patterns you evaluated and why you rejected them
- **Trade-offs**: Explicit discussion of pros/cons of your architectural choices
- **Scalability Considerations**: How the architecture handles growth

### 2. Complete LangGraph Architecture
- **Multiple Mermaid Diagrams**:
  - High-level system architecture (agent interactions)
  - Detailed state machine for each major workflow
  - Error handling and recovery flows
  - Data flow diagram
- **Agent Definitions**: Role, responsibilities, and capabilities of each agent
- **State Schema**: Complete state structure with all fields and their purposes
- **Edge Conditions**: All conditional logic and routing rules

### 3. Design Patterns Applied
For each pattern used, document:
- Pattern name and category
- Where it's applied in the architecture
- Why it's essential for this use case
- Implementation considerations

### 4. Implementation Roadmap
- Recommended tech stack (beyond LangGraph)
- Critical components to build first
- Testing strategy for financial operations
- Deployment and monitoring approach

### 5. Risk Mitigation
- Potential failure modes
- Detection mechanisms
- Recovery strategies
- Human intervention triggers

## Critical Success Factors

Your design MUST address:
- ✅ **Idempotency**: Same input produces same result, can safely retry
- ✅ **Atomicity**: Operations either fully complete or fully rollback
- ✅ **Validation Layers**: Multiple independent validation steps
- ✅ **Observable**: Full logging and monitoring capabilities
- ✅ **Testable**: Clear testing strategy for financial operations
- ✅ **Maintainable**: Clear separation of concerns, modular design

## Output Format

Structure your response as:

1. **Executive Summary** (2-3 paragraphs on your architectural approach)
2. **Research Insights** (Key findings from documentation analysis)
3. **Architecture Proposal** (With detailed Mermaid diagrams)
4. **Pattern Justification** (Why each pattern was selected)
5. **Implementation Guide** (Step-by-step with code considerations)
6. **Risk Analysis** (What could go wrong and how to prevent it)
7. **Next Steps** (Prioritized roadmap)

Be extremely thorough, critical, and precise. This is production code handling real money - surface-level analysis is not acceptable.
